I am Jheng-Hong (Matt) Yang, a __Ph.D. student__ in the [David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/) at the University of Waterloo.
I'm very happy to be supervised by Professor [Jimmy Lin](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/index.html).

Previously, I was a __research assistant__ in the Research Center for Information Technology Innovation at Academia Sinica and worked in the Computational Finance and Data Analytics and Computational Linguistics and Information Processing ([CFDA & CLIP](https://cfda.csie.org)) Labs.
During that time, I used to work on music recommender systems and time-series modeling for credit analysis.

I find joy in learning, helping others, and increasing humanity's efficiency, and the question that motivates me is: how can we use technology such as machine learning for societal good?

The best way to reach me is through my email: jheng-hong.yang [at] uwaterloo [dot] ca, and I am grateful for any positive or negative feedbacks.
